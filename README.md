# ImageEncryption
The combined Caesar and XOR cipher encryption works by first applying a Caesar shift to each byte of the plaintext image and then XOR-ing the resulting byte with a fixed key. This process is repeated for every byte of the image, resulting in an encrypted image where each byte is a combination of both the Caesar shift and the XOR key. To decrypt the image, the same operations are applied in reverse: first XOR-ing each byte with the fixed key, and then reversing the Caesar shift. The Python code for this encryption and decryption process is implemented using the Pillow library to manipulate the image data.
